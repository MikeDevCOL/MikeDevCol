## Hi there everyone

Here's Emanuel Obredor (Mike for my friends). I'm a developer passionate about the backend, with a full-stack mindset.

I mainly work with Java (Spring Boot) to build robust and scalable APIs, and I use Dart / JavaScript to develop user 
interfaces with Flutter or web technologies.

My goal is to grow into software engineering and artificial intelligence, focusing on designing clean architectures, 
writing testable and well-documented code, and delivering real value through efficient, maintainable software.  

> “Understanding the why behind the code is what makes the difference between just coding and truly creating solutions.” 

I'm currently working on a backend project for my own entrepreneurial business. His name is [ChillAndMixAPI](https://github.com/MikeDevCOL/ChillAndMixAPI). You can check the source code in my repositories.  

I’m currently learning about Machine Learning and Data Science.
